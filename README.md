# Project Astra
Data-Driven Real-Time Air Quality & Road Condition Monitoring System



📌 Overview

Project Astra is a real-time monitoring system designed to address critical urban challenges related to air pollution and road deterioration. The system uses low-cost sensors to collect environmental and road-condition data, transmits it through a mobile gateway using Bluetooth, and processes the data on the cloud using machine learning models. By leveraging standard network services such as DNS and SMTP, Project Astra ensures efficient data routing, real-time analysis, and timely alert delivery for smarter urban decision-making.



🎯 Objectives

* Monitor air quality and road conditions in real time
* Provide severity-based insights using machine learning
* Enable fast and reliable data transmission to the cloud
* Support proactive urban maintenance and environmental management



🚀 Key Features

* Sensor-based data collection
* Bluetooth-enabled transmission to mobile device
* Mobile device as a secure data gateway
* DNS-based routing to the nearest cloud server
* Cloud-based machine learning analysis
* Severity classification and alert generation
* SMTP-based email notifications



🏗 System Architecture
