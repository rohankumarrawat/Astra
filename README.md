# Astra
Project Astra is a real-time air quality and road condition monitoring system using sensor-based data collection. Data is sent via Bluetooth to a mobile gateway and forwarded to the nearest cloud server using DNS. A machine learning model analyzes severity levels and sends alerts via SMTP, enabling timely, data-driven urban management.
